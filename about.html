      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>Since high school, I have been taking college courses, allowing me to graduate nearly two years earlier than expected, ahead of my original date in May 2026. I enjoy challenging myself because I believe itâ€™s the best way to grow and learn.</p>
      <p>In Summer 2023, I studied abroad in South Korea at SKKU (Sungkyunkwan University), a prestigious institution known for its business program. I chose to study abroad to immerse myself in a new culture, experience unfamiliar environments, and broaden my perspective through diverse learning opportunities.</p>
